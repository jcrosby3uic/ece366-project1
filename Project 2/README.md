Project 2 Submission 1:
Github link: https://github.com/jcrosby3uic/ece366-project1

How to Run Fib & Odd Functions:
Step 1) Run Program
Step 2) Respond to prompt with input N
Step 3) read result from screen 
Step 4) Celebrate!

Summary:
Problem 1 involves creating a function using MIPS (assembly) that computes
if the nth fibonacci number is odd. Our implementation mirrors the C code, we
have a fibonacci subroutine that automatically enters a loop subroutine directly below it.
The number of executions needed is computed in $a0, the looping continues until the counter
reaches 0, at which point there is a jump to the end subroutine end_loop which stores the
final result in $v0.

Contributions:
All team members met virtually to contribute to the project's code. Josh (Jcrosby) is the primary
author of the MIPS files for problem 1 and 2, and pushed to the github. Leopold Serps is the primary author of problem 3 (combined problems 1 and 2) 
Leopold (lserp2) and Scott (skwok7) are the primary authors of this README file.
